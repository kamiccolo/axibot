Quick Start
===========


Install
-------

The recommended installation method is `pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/>`_.::

    $ pip install axibot

You can also download a source package here `directly from the Python Package
Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/axibot>`_.


AxiBot can be used via the command line or Python code. Tasks like real-time
control or plotting from sources other than SVG will generally require writing
Python code.


Plot a File
-----------

A number of example files are included in the source distribution. With a
typical rollerball pen and a sheet of US Letter paper (8.5" x 11") you can plot
the world map example::

    $ axibot plot examples/worldmap.svg
