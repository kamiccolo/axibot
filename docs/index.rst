AxiBot is an alternative control interface for the `AxiDraw pen plotting robot
<http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/846>`_ from Evil Mad Scientist
Labs.

The design goals are:

* Maintainble, hackable, codebase with light dependencies and the ability to
  run on a wide variety of embedded platforms.
* Excellent motion control, tuned to eliminate undesirable plotting artifacts.
* Easy command-line and programmatic use.
